# Stealth-adversarial-attacks
This repository contains a sample code for generating stealth adversarial attacks on a custom network trained on MNIST dataset

The code builds on MATLAB deep learning tutorial and uses several functions supplied my MathWorks:

1) modelPredictions.m
2) preprocessMiniBatch.m
3) preprocessMiniBatchPredictors.m

The main script is: Example_Stealth_Attack.m
